      <p>Pollack's work explores the relationship between personal and collective
        mythologies and the living surfaces of the canvas, revealing an interest
        in the ways in which painting contributes to the construction of identity.
        The images are a result of a continued process of considering these issues
        and trying to understand the nature of representation. From this perspective,
        he explores the way painting can simultaneously give reference to impermanence
        and the shifting visions of photography and the transience of a moment.
        In examining the discourse between social constructs and the art of painting,
        Pollack relies on nineteenth-century photographs as paradigms of memory
        and the passage of time. This work has also led him to investigate the
        role of &ldquo;museums&rdquo; in this process. The creation and display
        of painted documents, maps, signs, and portraits have also been included
        in recent exhibition-installations. In these works, style categories
        have been replaced with projects that allow for any image to be rendered
        in paint resulting in the perception of &quot;styles&quot; as a form
        of public language. Conceptually, his works proceed from the premise
      that all vision is historic and constructed.</p>
